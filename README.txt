==Open IFrame Block==

This is a quick, experimental which adds some javascript to Moodle (2.x) course pages to causes activities to open in an Iframe, within a YUI Panel, rather than moving to a new page.

It has many rough edges and has only been tested very briefly, but I wanted to share as a possible different way of navigating through activities.

==Installation==

Upload the files to [moodledir]/blocks/openiframe
Login as admin
Visit the 'home' page and click through the installation
Add the block to the front page
In the settings, select 'Display throughout entire site' for 'Panel contexts'
(Note the block will not appear with editing off, but the javascript will still work)
